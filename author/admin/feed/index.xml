					<description><![CDATA[A tiny Spotify player that frees you from your phone The Good&#160;The Mighty Vibe is a tiny music player with an integrated clip that stores downloaded Spotify playlists and podcasts. It has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can use it with Bluetooth headphones and speakers. It&#8217;s good for runners who don&#8217;t want to carry a phone around to listen to music. There&#8217;s a headphone jack for wired headphones. The Bad&#160;Bluetooth headphones are supposed to automatically re-pair, but some models may require manually re-pairing. Battery life is only OK. The Bottom Line&#160;The Mighty Vibe&#8217;s audience is limited to Spotify Premium users, but it&#8217;s an appealing little music player for those looking for an iPod Shuffle-like device to wear on the go and leave their phone at home. If you were sad when&#160;Apple&#8217;s iPod Shuffle&#160;was&#160;discontinued in 2017, you might find some solace in learning that the Mighty Vibe is essentially the new iPod Shuffle for the streaming era. It retails for&#160;$86 in the US&#160;and&#160;£61&#160;to&#160;£80 in the UK&#160;(via Amazon and elsewhere), but it&#8217;s also sometimes sold for as low as $69 (plus $5 shipping) from the manufacturer&#8217;s website (see discount details).&#160; Now, the big caveat from the &#8220;it&#8217;s like the Shuffle for streaming&#8221; is this: It has nothing to do with Apple or (blech!) iTunes. Instead it&#8217;s just for Spotify, the most popular subscription streaming music service in the world &#8212; and an an up-and-coming&#160;purveyor of podcasts&#160;too. With a 0.7-ounce (20-gram) body made of plastic instead of aluminum, it&#8217;s not quite as small or swanky looking as the Shuffle. But it&#8217;s pretty tiny and is designed to clip onto a piece of clothing &#8212; just like the Shuffle was. Those similarities aside, the Mighty Vibe has two key features missing from the Shuffle: Bluetooth wireless connectivity and the ability to download any song or podcast you want from Spotify. The caveat is that you have to be a&#160;Spotify Premium&#160;subscriber to use it. That&#8217;ll cost you $10 (£10 or AU$12) a month. Some people experienced Bluetooth hiccups with&#160;Mighty&#8217;s first-generation player. Addressing those complaints, Mighty said it has improved the Bluetooth performance for both connectivity and range in the Vibe. It seemed mostly fine to me, and fellow CNET editor David Katzmaier also didn&#8217;t encounter any major issues. Setup and synching were straightforward and I had no problem re-pairing the device with the Mighty app &#8212; it&#8217;s&#160;available for iOS and Android&#160;&#8212; when I needed to refresh a playlist with additional songs or add another playlist. While the Vibe is connected to the app on your iOS or Android device via Bluetooth, you transfer playlists over Wi-Fi. That means your phone and Vibe need to be on the same Wi-Fi network for synching. It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that when you transfer playlists you can choose between three quality levels &#8212; Normal, High and Extreme. If you use the Normal setting transfers are faster, but syncing proceeds with reasonable speed regardless of what setting you choose, thanks to the Wi-Fi connection. How you like The Mighty Vibe ?

					<description><![CDATA[Finding a laptop under $500 for&#160;Windows&#160;or Chrome OS (also known as a&#160;Chromebook) has become more challenging since the COVID-19 pandemic forced both office workers and students to start working from home. While we are starting to finally get past the&#160;coronavirus-induced work-from-home rush, when&#160;PC and accessory sales spiked, there&#8217;s still a strong demand for a budget laptop and other&#160;ultracheap hardware. Even though demand is high, we urge you not to make any rash decisions. There are a lot of cheap laptops that are just not worth it. But there are a few that are &#8212; we&#8217;re highlighting our picks for the best laptops under $500 to help you sort through the competition and find the one with the features and hardware specifications that are right for you. You can also&#160;try to make your current laptop last a little longer. If you just need something to tide you over for a few months, dig into possible places to buy refurbished machines, and explore nonprofit or educational discounts if you&#8217;re eligible. Also, if there&#8217;s something you really want in a laptop, like a touch screen, backlit keyboard or HDMI port, definitely look for something with that feature. You&#8217;ll regret it if you don&#8217;t. If you suspect you&#8217;ll be holding onto your new laptop a while, see if you can stretch your budget to buy a slightly more expensive laptop to accommodate a little more memory or a processor with more cores than you were otherwise considering. If you haven&#8217;t thought about it, look at AMD Ryzen processors as alternatives to Intel Core. Even better, if you&#8217;re comfortable with it, think about an affordable laptop with a replaceable battery, or upgradable memory, graphics card and storage, or all of the above. Furthermore, you&#160;won&#8217;t be stuck at home forever. Remember to consider whether having a lighter-weight laptop with good battery life will be important to you in the future.&#160; You can always add an external drive or two (or five, if you&#8217;re me) at some point down the road. But if your internal storage is the type of slow-spinning hard drive that comes in a lot of cheap laptop models, even fast external storage is unlikely to help speed up loading Windows or applications. (You can frequently set a system to boot from an external solid-state drive if necessary.) You may see references to &#8220;Intel Optane&#8221; in conjunction with slow (5,400rpm) spinning hard drives; Optane is fast solid-state memory that acts as a temporary storage space for frequently accessed files on the hard drive to speed things up. It helps, but not as much as an SSD drive.&#160; And finally, if you&#8217;re replacing an old Windows laptop that&#8217;s just not up to running Windows anymore,&#160;consider turning it into a Chromebook. Trade-offs As long as you manage your expectations when it comes to options and specs, you can still get quite a bit from a budget laptop model, including good battery life and a reasonably lightweight laptop body.&#160; A bright spot is you don&#8217;t have to settle for a traditional clamshell laptop with a fixed display and keyboard.&#160;You can also get a convertible laptop (otherwise known as a two-in-one), which has a screen that flips around to turn the screen into a tablet, to position it for comfortable streaming or to do a presentation. Keep in mind that all convertibles have a touch screen, which is a prerequisite for tablet operation, and many support styluses (aka &#8220;pens&#8221;) for handwritten and sketched input. Don&#8217;t assume a stylus is included with it, though. One thing you won&#8217;t find at these prices: a&#160;MacBook&#160;or any other Apple laptop. Even an&#160;iPad Air&#160;tablet will run you more than $500 once you buy the optional keyboard (though if you look for sales on the tablet or keyboard it might work out to less), which is above our budget here. A&#160;base-model iPad&#160;with an inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard and cheap stand for the iPad might suffice, though. You&#8217;ll see a lot of cheap laptops listed as coming with&#160;Windows 10 S, a stripped-down and locked-down version of the operating system intended for use by schools &#8212; it only allows you to install applications from the Windows Store, forces you to use&#160;Microsoft&#8217;s Edge browser&#160;and includes a subset of the administrative tools in&#160;Windows 10 Pro. You can upgrade to the full version for free, though. &#160; It&#8217;s easier to find inexpensive&#160;Chromebooks&#160;than Windows laptops, making it one of the most popular categories of budget laptop on the market, though we&#8217;re also seeing a lot more Chromebooks in the $500-to-$1,000 range. That&#8217;s because Google&#8217;s Chrome OS isn&#8217;t nearly as power-hungry as Windows (check the specs), so you can get by with a lower-end processor, slower storage and less screen resolution or memory &#8212; just a few of the components that make a laptop expensive.&#160; But the flip side is that while Chrome OS isn&#8217;t as power-hungry as Windows, Chrome and Google apps are unfortunately more of a memory hog than you&#8217;d expect, and if you go too low with the processor or skimp on memory, the system will still feel slow. Chrome OS is also a much different experience than Windows; make sure the applications you need have a&#160;Chrome app&#160;before making the leap. Since they&#8217;re cloud-first devices, however, you don&#8217;t need a lot of storage built in. That also means if you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or playing Android games, they&#8217;re a good fit. If you hope to play Android games, make sure you get a touchscreen laptop model. For a cheap gaming laptop, though, you&#8217;ll still have to break the $500 ceiling to support most games. The least expensive budget laptops suitable for a solid gaming performance experience &#8212; those with even moderately powerful discrete graphics processors &#8212; will run you closer to $700. Here are our&#160;recommendations if you&#8217;re looking for the best gaming laptop.&#160; Although, if you like to live on the bleeding edge, cloud gaming services such as&#160;Google Stadia&#160;and&#160;Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&#160;will let you play games on laptops with specs that hit the under-$500 mark. Specs to keep in mind While Chromebooks can run Chrome OS-specific and Android apps, some people need the full Windows operating system to run heftier applications, such as video editing suites. With that comes a need for a faster processor with more cores, more memory &#8212; 8GB is the bare minimum &#8212; and more storage for applications and the operating system itself. A lot of these have 4GB or 6GB, which in conjunction with a spinning hard disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows experience as well.&#160; I&#8217;m seeing a lot of Windows laptops in this range use AMD Athlon and lower-end A series and Intel Celeron processors to hit the lower price. I don&#8217;t really recommend going with an Athlon instead of a Ryzen or a Celeron instead of a Core: Windows is just too heavy for them, and in conjunction with the 4GB memory a lot of them have, you may find them abysmally slow at best. Because of their low prices, 11-inch Chromebooks are attractive. But we don&#8217;t recommend that size for any but the youngest students. And for remote learning, if you&#8217;re both going to be looking at the screen frequently, 11 inches can get really cramped. SSDs can make a big difference in how fast Windows performance feels compared with a spinning hard disk, but they also push the price up. So if your budget can stretch a little and you want more storage, you may want to consider stepping up from base storage options to a 128GB SSD.&#160; In the budget price range you have to watch out for screen terminology when it comes to specs: an &#8220;HD&#8221; screen may not always be a truly high-definition screen. HD, which has a resolution of 1,920&#215;1,080 pixels, is sometimes called &#8220;Full HD&#8221; so marketers can refer to lesser-resolution displays (1,280&#215;720 pixels) as HD. In Chromebooks, HD usually refers to a screen with a resolution of 1,366&#215;768 pixels. Another frequent complaint I see is about &#8220;washed-out&#8221; looking displays with poor viewing angles. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s one of the trade-offs you&#8217;ve got to live with; a lot of these use TN (twisted nematic) screen technology, which is cheap but meh. Pay attention to networking. Inexpensive models with older chipsets may only support Wi-Fi 3 (or 802.11b/g/n). Wi-Fi 3 is limited to 2.4GHz channels; those are slower than more recent chipsets with Wi-Fi 4 (aka 802.11ac) that add a 5GHz channel as well. The specifications aren&#8217;t always correct on the shopping sites, so if you see a model that doesn&#8217;t seem to have Wi-Fi 4, double-check on the manufacturer&#8217;s site before ruling it out. Remember, Chromebooks are designed to work predominantly over the internet, so Wi-Fi speed and stability are crucial.&#160; Considering all specs and options &#8212; battery life, storage space, screen resolution, screen size, core processor performance and general machine and battery performance &#8212; these are a few of our top picks for 2021&#8217;s best Windows laptops and Chromebooks under the $500 budget, along with their pros and cons. Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook Chrome OS Like the Go, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a 10-inch tablet with a detachable keyboard and touchpad. Unlike Microsoft, though, Lenovo includes the keyboard. This Lenovo laptop also costs much less than the Microsoft Surface Go (including&#160;the Microsoft Surface Go 2), starting at $249 list for a 64GB version or $299 for one with 128GB of storage. The Lenovo IdeaPad is essentially a smaller, albeit less powerful,&#160;Pixel Slate&#160;that makes more sense for more people with a price that&#8217;s more in line with what people expect a Chromebook to cost.&#160; &#160;&#160; The screen is small, however, so if you&#8217;re regularly using it at a desk, we recommend attaching an&#160;external monitor&#160;to its USB-C port. You&#8217;ll probably want to connect&#160;a wireless keyboard&#160;and&#160;mouse, too. Acer Aspire 5 Windows The 2019 Acer Aspire 5 15-inch clamshell includes an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, with its Vega graphics processing. It also features a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port, 2 2.0 USB port options and HDMI port. The 4GB RAM and 128GB solid-state drive storage don&#8217;t allow you to have many programs or lots of browser tabs open simultaneously, but this Acer Aspire 15-inch-screen model does weigh less than 4 pounds. Subsequent models have replaced it over the past few years, but this one keeps hanging in there. Read our Acer Aspire 5 (2019) review. HP Chromebook x360 14c Chrome OS If you&#8217;d rather have a wider screen instead of the taller one of a 13-inch model, this HP is the way to go. It&#8217;s a bit wider than a premium 13.3-inch model, but that extra width makes it easier to work in two windows side by side. The two-in-one design means you can use it as a tablet (though it&#8217;s a bit heavy to use handheld) or tent it and connect an external keyboard and mouse and use it as a small all-in-one computer.&#160; In our testing, the Core i3 processor and 8GB of memory kept it running smoothly even with a couple dozen tabs open and streaming video in the background. And it has a long battery life to boot, lasting 10 hours, 40 minutes in our tests. Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Flex 5 2-in-1 Chrome Os This Lenovo laptop is somewhat small, with a 13-inch, full HD display, but the Flex 5 delivers convertible laptop convenience as well as excellent performance and battery life for the money thanks to an Intel Core i3-10110U processor, 4GB memory and 64GB SSD storage. The Lenovo Flex is not a great choice for outdoor use, since the display is pretty dim. Samsung Chromebook 4 Chrome OS This is a pretty straightforward 15-inch Samsung Chromebook equipped with a Celeron N4000, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage (plus an extra 32GB via an SD card). There are less expensive laptop versions of the Samsung Chromebook at the same link starting at $390, but they&#8217;re all 11-inch models, so unless it&#8217;s for a small kid or a small space, I&#8217;d hesitate to...]]></description>

<p>You may see references to &#8220;Intel Optane&#8221; in conjunction with slow (5,400rpm) spinning hard drives; Optane is fast solid-state memory that acts as a temporary storage space for frequently accessed files on the hard drive to speed things up. It helps, but not as much as an SSD drive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, if you&#8217;re replacing an old Windows laptop that&#8217;s just not up to running Windows anymore,&nbsp;consider turning it into a Chromebook.</p>



<h2>Trade-offs</h2>



<p>As long as you manage your expectations when it comes to options and specs, you can still get quite a bit from a budget laptop model, including good battery life and a reasonably lightweight laptop body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A bright spot is you don&#8217;t have to settle for a traditional clamshell laptop with a fixed display and keyboard.&nbsp;You can also get a convertible laptop (otherwise known as a two-in-one), which has a screen that flips around to turn the screen into a tablet, to position it for comfortable streaming or to do a presentation. Keep in mind that all convertibles have a touch screen, which is a prerequisite for tablet operation, and many support styluses (aka &#8220;pens&#8221;) for handwritten and sketched input. Don&#8217;t assume a stylus is included with it, though.</p>



<p>One thing you won&#8217;t find at these prices: a&nbsp;MacBook&nbsp;or any other Apple laptop. Even an&nbsp;iPad Air&nbsp;tablet will run you more than $500 once you buy the optional keyboard (though if you look for sales on the tablet or keyboard it might work out to less), which is above our budget here. A&nbsp;base-model iPad&nbsp;with an inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard and cheap stand for the iPad might suffice, though.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll see a lot of cheap laptops listed as coming with&nbsp;Windows 10 S, a stripped-down and locked-down version of the operating system intended for use by schools &#8212; it only allows you to install applications from the Windows Store, forces you to use&nbsp;Microsoft&#8217;s Edge browser&nbsp;and includes a subset of the administrative tools in&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro. You can upgrade to the full version for free, though. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easier to find inexpensive&nbsp;Chromebooks&nbsp;than Windows laptops, making it one of the most popular categories of budget laptop on the market, though we&#8217;re also seeing a lot more Chromebooks in the $500-to-$1,000 range. That&#8217;s because Google&#8217;s Chrome OS isn&#8217;t nearly as power-hungry as Windows (check the specs), so you can get by with a lower-end processor, slower storage and less screen resolution or memory &#8212; just a few of the components that make a laptop expensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the flip side is that while Chrome OS isn&#8217;t as power-hungry as Windows, Chrome and Google apps are unfortunately more of a memory hog than you&#8217;d expect, and if you go too low with the processor or skimp on memory, the system will still feel slow. Chrome OS is also a much different experience than Windows; make sure the applications you need have a&nbsp;Chrome app&nbsp;before making the leap.</p>



<p>Since they&#8217;re cloud-first devices, however, you don&#8217;t need a lot of storage built in. That also means if you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or playing Android games, they&#8217;re a good fit. If you hope to play Android games, make sure you get a touchscreen laptop model.</p>



<p>For a cheap gaming laptop, though, you&#8217;ll still have to break the $500 ceiling to support most games. The least expensive budget laptops suitable for a solid gaming performance experience &#8212; those with even moderately powerful discrete graphics processors &#8212; will run you closer to $700. Here are our&nbsp;recommendations if you&#8217;re looking for the best gaming laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although, if you like to live on the bleeding edge, cloud gaming services such as&nbsp;Google Stadia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&nbsp;will let you play games on laptops with specs that hit the under-$500 mark.</p>



<h2>Specs to keep in mind</h2>



<p>While Chromebooks can run Chrome OS-specific and Android apps, some people need the full Windows operating system to run heftier applications, such as video editing suites. With that comes a need for a faster processor with more cores, more memory &#8212; 8GB is the bare minimum &#8212; and more storage for applications and the operating system itself. A lot of these have 4GB or 6GB, which in conjunction with a spinning hard disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows experience as well.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>I&#8217;m seeing a lot of Windows laptops in this range use AMD Athlon and lower-end A series and Intel Celeron processors to hit the lower price. I don&#8217;t really recommend going with an Athlon instead of a Ryzen or a Celeron instead of a Core: Windows is just too heavy for them, and in conjunction with the 4GB memory a lot of them have, you may find them abysmally slow at best.</li><li>Because of their low prices, 11-inch Chromebooks are attractive. But we don&#8217;t recommend that size for any but the youngest students. And for remote learning, if you&#8217;re both going to be looking at the screen frequently, 11 inches can get really cramped.</li><li>SSDs can make a big difference in how fast Windows performance feels compared with a spinning hard disk, but they also push the price up. So if your budget can stretch a little and you want more storage, you may want to consider stepping up from base storage options to a 128GB SSD.&nbsp;</li><li>In the budget price range you have to watch out for screen terminology when it comes to specs: an &#8220;HD&#8221; screen may not always be a truly high-definition screen. HD, which has a resolution of 1,920&#215;1,080 pixels, is sometimes called &#8220;Full HD&#8221; so marketers can refer to lesser-resolution displays (1,280&#215;720 pixels) as HD. In Chromebooks, HD usually refers to a screen with a resolution of 1,366&#215;768 pixels. Another frequent complaint I see is about &#8220;washed-out&#8221; looking displays with poor viewing angles. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s one of the trade-offs you&#8217;ve got to live with; a lot of these use TN (twisted nematic) screen technology, which is cheap but meh.</li><li>Pay attention to networking. Inexpensive models with older chipsets may only support Wi-Fi 3 (or 802.11b/g/n). Wi-Fi 3 is limited to 2.4GHz channels; those are slower than more recent chipsets with Wi-Fi 4 (aka 802.11ac) that add a 5GHz channel as well. The specifications aren&#8217;t always correct on the shopping sites, so if you see a model that doesn&#8217;t seem to have Wi-Fi 4, double-check on the manufacturer&#8217;s site before ruling it out. Remember, Chromebooks are designed to work predominantly over the internet, so Wi-Fi speed and stability are crucial.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Considering all specs and options &#8212; battery life, storage space, screen resolution, screen size, core processor performance and general machine and battery performance &#8212; these are a few of our top picks for 2021&#8217;s best Windows laptops and Chromebooks under the $500 budget, along with their pros and cons.</p>



<p><strong>Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chrome OS</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://nptb0503.github.io/cnet/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dsc1276_1280x720-800-resize.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15"/><figcaption>Lenovo IdeaPad</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like the Go, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a 10-inch tablet with a detachable keyboard and touchpad. Unlike Microsoft, though, Lenovo includes the keyboard. This Lenovo laptop also costs much less than the Microsoft Surface Go (including&nbsp;the Microsoft Surface Go 2), starting at $249 list for a 64GB version or $299 for one with 128GB of storage. The Lenovo IdeaPad is essentially a smaller, albeit less powerful,&nbsp;Pixel Slate&nbsp;that makes more sense for more people with a price that&#8217;s more in line with what people expect a Chromebook to cost.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The screen is small, however, so if you&#8217;re regularly using it at a desk, we recommend attaching an&nbsp;external monitor&nbsp;to its USB-C port. You&#8217;ll probably want to connect&nbsp;a wireless keyboard&nbsp;and&nbsp;mouse, too.</p>

<p>The 2019 Acer Aspire 5 15-inch clamshell includes an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U, with its Vega graphics processing. It also features a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port, 2 2.0 USB port options and HDMI port. The 4GB RAM and 128GB solid-state drive storage don&#8217;t allow you to have many programs or lots of browser tabs open simultaneously, but this Acer Aspire 15-inch-screen model does weigh less than 4 pounds. Subsequent models have replaced it over the past few years, but this one keeps hanging in there.</p>

<p><strong>HP Chromebook x360 14c</strong></p>



<p><strong>Chrome OS</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://nptb0503.github.io/cnet/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hp-chromebook-x360-14c-frontleft.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18"/><figcaption>HP Chromebook x360 14c</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;d rather have a wider screen instead of the taller one of a 13-inch model, this HP is the way to go. It&#8217;s a bit wider than a premium 13.3-inch model, but that extra width makes it easier to work in two windows side by side. The two-in-one design means you can use it as a tablet (though it&#8217;s a bit heavy to use handheld) or tent it and connect an external keyboard and mouse and use it as a small all-in-one computer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our testing, the Core i3 processor and 8GB of memory kept it running smoothly even with a couple dozen tabs open and streaming video in the background. And it has a long battery life to boot, lasting 10 hours, 40 minutes in our tests.</p>

<p><strong>Lenovo IdeaPad Chromebook Flex 5 2-in-1</strong></p>

<p>This Lenovo laptop is somewhat small, with a 13-inch, full HD display, but the Flex 5 delivers convertible laptop convenience as well as excellent performance and battery life for the money thanks to an Intel Core i3-10110U processor, 4GB memory and 64GB SSD storage. The Lenovo Flex is not a great choice for outdoor use, since the display is pretty dim.</p>

<p>This is a pretty straightforward 15-inch Samsung Chromebook equipped with a Celeron N4000, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage (plus an extra 32GB via an SD card). There are less expensive laptop versions of the Samsung Chromebook at the same link starting at $390, but they&#8217;re all 11-inch models, so unless it&#8217;s for a small kid or a small space, I&#8217;d hesitate to get one of those.</p>

<p><strong>Asus VivoBook 15</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Amazon currently offers an older Core i3 8GB model for about $435, a reasonable price for a Windows laptop with an Intel Core processor. You&#8217;ll also see listings with 4GB RAM, but that&#8217;s way too little memory for Windows, which barely gets by on 8GB. Don&#8217;t confuse it with the thinner, lighter, more expensive Asus VivoBook S15.</p>



<p>Newer models are on their way &#8212; not quite in stock yet &#8212; and there&#8217;s a 2020 Asus VivoBook model that just squeaks in under $500, but it&#8217;s got a higher-end Ryzen 5 processor and more storage. You can&nbsp;check the stock at B&amp;H&nbsp;if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<p>This Acer Chromebook is on the high side for a &#8220;budget&#8221; Chromebook, but has a full HD 15-inch display that can open completely to lie flat, and boasts solid everyday performance &#8212; with an Intel Core i3-8130U, Intel HD graphics display, 4GB memory and 128GB storage &#8212; plus great battery life.</p>

<p>HP&#8217;s higher-end mainstream two-in-one is at the top of the range, but this HP laptop has a surprisingly nice configuration for the money. You get a 10th-gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD, as well as the convenience of a convertible and the better construction of the Pavilion line. The display isn&#8217;t real HD, but at 14 inches that shouldn&#8217;t be a big problem.</p>

<p>The internet was brought to its knees by a massive outage on Tuesday. Now we know exactly what the cause was, and how the problem was fixed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://nptb0503.github.io/cnet/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Data-technology-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6"/><figcaption>Not Fastly&#8217;s proudest moment.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tuesday will be remembered as the day the internet broke &#8212; before swiftly being fixed again. Early in the morning, websites including Amazon, Reddit, Spotify, eBay, Twitch, Pinterest and, unfortunately, CNET went offline due to a major outage at a service called Fastly. Everywhere you looked, there were 503 errors and people complaining they couldn&#8217;t access key services and news outlets. Within 24 hours, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/summary-of-june-8-outage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">found out the root cause of the outage</a>.</p>



<p>After an investigation into what went wrong, Fastly published a blog post describing exactly what went down &#8212; and it turns out the whole incident was triggered by just a single, unnamed Fastly customer.</p>



<p>In mid-May, Fastly issued a software deployment that contained a bug, which if triggered in specific circumstances could take down vast swaths of its network. The bug lay dormant until June 8, when one Fastly customer inadvertently triggered it during a &#8220;valid configuration change,&#8221; which caused 85% of the company&#8217;s network to return errors.</p>



<p>&#8220;We detected the disruption within 1 minute, then identified and isolated the cause, and disabled the configuration,&#8221; said Nick Rockwell, Fastly&#8217;s senior vice president of engineering and infrastructure, in the blog post. &#8220;Within 49 minutes, 95% of our network was operating as normal. This outage was broad and severe, and we&#8217;re truly sorry for the impact to our customers and everyone who relies on them.&#8221;</p>



<h2>What happened during the Fastly outage?</h2>



<p>At around 2:58 a.m. PT, Fastly&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://status.fastly.com/" target="_blank">status update page</a> noted an error, saying &#8220;we&#8217;re currently investigating potential impact to performance with our CDN [content delivery network] services.&#8221; Shortly thereafter, reports emerged on Twitter of major news publications including the BBC, CNN and The New York Times being offline. Twitter itself was still running, although the server that hosted its emojis went down, leading to some odd-looking tweets.</p>



<p>Rather than isolated incidents affecting individual sites, it turned out this was a massive outage that had brought much of the internet to its knees. Across the world, people were receiving Error: 503 messages as they tried to access sites, including some vital services, such as the UK government&#8217;s gov.uk web properties.</p>



<p>Almost an hour later, at 3:44 a.m. PT &#8212; or 6:44 a.m. ET, on the cusp of the US East Coast workday, and coming up on noon in the UK &#8212; Fastly updated its status page again to say the issue has been identified and a fix was being implemented. At 4:10 a.m. PT, the company tweeted: &#8220;We identified a service configuration that triggered disruptions across our POPs globally and have disabled that configuration. Our global network is coming back online.&#8221;https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=katiecollins&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1402221348659814411&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Ffastly-internet-outage-explained-how-one-customer-broke-amazon-reddit-and-half-the-web%2F&amp;sessionId=33c1641c06061f8cffe6018b20181286c1ebcdd8&amp;siteScreenName=CNET&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&amp;width=550px</p>



<p>The same message was sent to CNET as a comment by Fastly spokespeople.</p>



<h2>What is Fastly?</h2>



<p>Fastly is a cloud computing service provider, headquartered in San Francisco, that&#8217;s been around since 2011. In 2017, it launched an edge cloud platform designed to bring websites closer to the people who use them. Effectively this means that if you&#8217;re accessing a website hosted in another country, it will store some of that website closer to you so that there&#8217;s no need to waste bandwidth by going to fetch all of that website&#8217;s content from far away every time you need it.</p>



<p>This makes for faster website load times, and optimizes images, videos and other high-payload content to show up quickly and smoothly when you land on a web page. Among the boasts on the company&#8217;s website, it says it made loading pages on Buzzfeed 50% faster and allowed The New York Times to simultaneously handle 2 million readers on election night. Edge computing also performs vital cybersecurity functions, protecting sites from DDoS attacks and bots, as well as providing a web application firewall.</p>



<p>Due to the way Fastly sits between the back-end web servers and the front-facing internet as we see it, any errors on its part can cause whole websites to be unavailable. Due to the localized nature of the edge cloud platform, it also means that errors don&#8217;t affect all regions in the same way at the same time (although people all across the world reported experiencing problems on Tuesday).</p>



<h2>What is a 503 error?</h2>



<p>When you see a website displaying a 503 error rather than showing you the page you were expecting, it means the server hosting the website isn&#8217;t ready to handle the request. It also indicates that the problem is temporary and that it will likely be resolved soon.</p>



<p>Commonly, it is caused when a server is down for maintenance, or when a website has been overloaded &#8212; for example, if too many people are trying to access it at once.</p>

<h2>Why did Fastly fail on Tuesday and will it happen again?</h2>



<p>We now know that Tuesday&#8217;s internet outage was caused by a service configuration change by one of Fastly&#8217;s customers that triggered a bug hidden in Fastly&#8217;s network. The bug had been lying dormant since a software update deployment by Fastly on May 6.</p>



<p>To make sure the problem doesn&#8217;t repeat itself, Fastly has said it&#8217;s taking a number of actions. It is deploying a bug fix across its network, while also conducting a complete post-mortem of the processes and practices it followed during the incident. It&#8217;s also going to be figuring out why it didn&#8217;t catch the bug during its own testing processes and evaluating ways to improve remediation time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though there were specific conditions that triggered this outage, we should have anticipated it,&#8221; said Rockwell. &#8220;We provide mission critical services, and we treat any action that can cause service issues with the utmost sensitivity and priority.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many people speculated on Twitter that the outage was caused by a cyberattack, but we now know that this wasn&#8217;t the case. There are many technical reasons a CDN can fail, and cyberattacks are just one of them. It is concerning, however, to see quite how vulnerable they can be.</p>



<p>&#8220;CDNs are part of the internet&#8217;s critical infrastructure and if threat actors hadn&#8217;t already cottoned on to this as a direct attack vector to bring down the internet, they will now after monitoring [Tuesday&#8217;s] misfortunate events,&#8221; said Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at security firm ESET in a statement.</p>



<h2>Why were so many websites affected by the Fastly outage?</h2>



<p>Fastly is a widely used service by web publishers &#8212; and it became apparent exactly how widely used on Tuesday when vast swaths of the internet became unavailable. The whole incident demonstrated just how much of the internet relies on this largely unheard-of cloud computing service.</p>



<p>The reason it&#8217;s so popular is that the services it provides are considered essential by many online web properties, but not many companies provide these services. As such, a vast number of websites are reliant on a very small group of companies to keep running. Similar problems were seen when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cloudflare-dns-outage-makes-websites-unreachable/">Cloudflare was hit with an outage</a>&nbsp;last July, and when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-web-service-outage-takes-down-major-apps-and-sites/">Amazon Web Services went down</a>&nbsp;last November.</p>



<p>As Corinne Cath-Speth, a Ph.D. candidate at Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/C___CS/status/1402224754124337152?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pointed out on Twitter</a>, this means &#8220;a technical hiccup in a single company can have huge ramifications.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This in turn &#8212; raises major questions about the dangers of (power) consolidation in the cloud market and the unquestioned influence these often invisible actors have over access to information,&#8221; she added.</p>

<h2>What is Fastly?</h2>



<p>Fastly is a cloud computing service provider, headquartered in San Francisco, that&#8217;s been around since 2011. In 2017, it launched an edge cloud platform designed to bring websites closer to the people who use them. Effectively this means that if you&#8217;re accessing a website hosted in another country, it will store some of that website closer to you so that there&#8217;s no need to waste bandwidth by going to fetch all of that website&#8217;s content from far away every time you need it.</p>



<p>This makes for faster website load times, and optimizes images, videos and other high-payload content to show up quickly and smoothly when you land on a web page. Among the boasts on the company&#8217;s website, it says it made loading pages on Buzzfeed 50% faster and allowed The New York Times to simultaneously handle 2 million readers on election night. Edge computing also performs vital cybersecurity functions, protecting sites from DDoS attacks and bots, as well as providing a web application firewall.</p>



<p>Due to the way Fastly sits between the back-end web servers and the front-facing internet as we see it, any errors on its part can cause whole websites to be unavailable. Due to the localized nature of the edge cloud platform, it also means that errors don&#8217;t affect all regions in the same way at the same time (although people all across the world reported experiencing problems on Tuesday).</p>
